In chemistry, molecules are groups of atoms bonded together that take on
distinct new properties. For instance, water molecules and hydrogen peroxide
molecules have their own unique properties and behave quite differently, even
though theyâ€™re made up of the same atomic elements (hydrogen and oxygen).

In interfaces, molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements
functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and
button can join together to create a search form molecule.
